GalacticTweaks was created to provide fixes and customizations to Galacticraft. Most of the features added are in part due to them
not being able to set within Galacticraft itself or fixes a certain aspect of the mod that has not been fixed in the source-code.

There are also features that either add-to or help fix minor details in addon's. These features aim to be as non-intrusive as possible
to the addon.

.. WARNING::
	Features can and will be removed or changed if the content it refers to receives a fix in Galacticraft. 

.. Important::
	All features are disabled by default. You will need to start Minecraft once to generate the configuration file, once generated you will need to close minecraft, enable and configure the features you want, then restart minecraft
